# Recoil

This repo is where I play around with the Recoil state management library for React.

## Plan

1. I plan on following along the official Recoil docs.
2. Then, I will create a small yet interactive application to test my understanding of Recoil. I'm thinking of a tic-tac-toe app with an extremely simple server.
